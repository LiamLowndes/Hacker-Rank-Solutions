## Iterables and Iterators

You are given a list of N lowercase English letters. For a given integer K, you can select any K indices (assume 1-based indexing) with a uniform probability from the list.

Find the probability that at least one of the K indices selected will contain the letter: 'a'.

### Input Format

The input consists of three lines. The first line contains the integer N, denoting the length of the list. The next line consists of N space-separated lowercase English letters, denoting the elements of the list.

The third and the last line of input contains the integer K  denoting the number of indices to be selected.

### Output Format

Output a single line consisting of the probability that at least one of the indices selected contains the letter:'a'.

Note: The answer must be correct up to 3 decimal places.

### Constraints

1 <= N <= 10
1 <= K <= N
All the letters in the list are lowercase English letters.
